Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At the end of the Rating section, add missing closing div:
                  ))}
                </div>
                <span className="text-gray-700 font-semibold text-lg">
                  {product.rating} ({product.reviews} reviews)
                </span>
              </div>

// The file was missing several closing brackets at the very end. Here they are:
};

export default ProductPage;
```

The main issues were:

1. A malformed Rating section that had some mixed up JSX
2. Missing closing brackets at the end of the component

The file should now be properly closed and balanced with all required brackets and JSX elements properly terminated.
